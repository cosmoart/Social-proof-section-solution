### What I learned

<img src="./images/problem.png" alt="stars section" width="35%" align="right">

The main challenge that was presented to me was to make the "stars section" because I didn't want to use img in the html (there would be 15 img). The first idea was to use background-image, but I had the problem that the stars were too close together, researching I came up with the idea of editing the svg of the star so that it had a space that simulated the margin and created that space between stars .

### Useful resources

-   [CSS, background-repeat distance - Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16875466/css-background-repeat-distance) - This gave me the idea to edit the svg so that it had a space on the sides, looking a bit like the margins I was looking for.
